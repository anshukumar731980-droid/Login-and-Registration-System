# Login-and-Registration-System
Login and Registration System is basically:  1. Registration â€“ A new user signs up by entering details like username, password, email, etc. The system stores this data securely (usually in a database or a file).  2. Login - An existing user enters their credentials. The system checks them against stored data and allows access if correct.
