# Login and Registration System

This project is a simple **Login and Registration System** implemented in C++.

## Features
- User Registration (sign up with username and password)
- User Login (authenticate with stored credentials)
- Basic file handling to store and retrieve user data

## File Structure
- `Login and Registration System.cpp` : The main C++ source code file containing the system implementation.

## How to Compile and Run

### Using g++ (Linux/Mac)
```bash
g++ "Login and Registration System.cpp" -o login_system
./login_system
```

### Using MinGW (Windows)
```bash
g++ "Login and Registration System.cpp" -o login_system.exe
login_system.exe
```

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler such as `g++` or `clang++`.

## Future Improvements
- Password encryption for better security.
- Input validation and error handling.
- Improved user interface (menu-driven system).
- Option to reset or change password.
